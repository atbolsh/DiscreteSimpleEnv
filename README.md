Small platform to quickly make environments with walls, gold, and a simple agent.

Primarily targeted at quick development of environments for RL; python boilerplate 
coming soon.

Heavily relies on p5.js, which is not included in this repo, but can be downloaded here:
https://p5js.org/download/

We recommend getting the full p5.js source code file, and then putting this in the same directory as canvas.html

To run a minimal server, we recommend following p5.js guidelines. 
The code was developed / tested using the simple command "python -m http.server" and standard browsers.
